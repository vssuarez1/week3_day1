# # Review
# create variables for the following :
# 1. age
age= 16 # interger variable
# 2. name
name= "Ruby" # string variable
# 3. song
song= "Ruby Cool" #string variable
# 4. food
food= "rice" # string variable
# 5. number
number= 635 # interger variable


# #now include the variables you just made print in the following...
# concatenation --- + around your variables 

# Once upon a time, there was a [age] old coder named [name].
print("Once upon a time, there was a " + str(age) + " old coder named "+ name + ".")
print("there was a number " + str(number) + " as well")
#put the age and number in a sentence
print("The age " + str(age) + " and number " + str(number) + " are both numbers.")
date_of_birth = 2021
number2 = 123
number3 = 123.456
number4 = 123.33 
number5 = 4555
#create a sentence of all this above
print("Date of birth is " + str(date_of_birth) + " and the numbers are " + str(number2) + "," + str(number3) + "," + str(number4) + ",and " + str(number5) + ".")
print(f"the date of birth is {date_of_birth} and the number is {number2} and the number is {number3} and the number is { number4} and the number is {number5}")
# [name] liked to hum the song [song] while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw [food] until [name] would stop singing.
print("Ruby liked to hum the song " + song + " while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw " + food + " until " + name + " would stop singing." )

# Still, [name] was the best coder on the team and could write [number] lines of code every day. Maybe [song] was [name]â€™s secret power?

# The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# 1. Names can not start with a number.
# 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
# 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
# 5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh),
#    or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
# 6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"


# Here are some exercises to practice the rules:


# Correcting Invalid Names: Below are some invalid names. Correct them according to the rules:


# first_name
# last_name
# email_address
# percent
# variable_name
# zero
# list # this is a key word in python
#you cannot use it for your own variable name 
# Creating Valid Names: Create valid names for the following descriptions:


# The first name of a person
# The last name of a person
# The email address of a person
# The percentage of marks obtained by a student
# A variable to store the number of items in a shopping cart




# Identify Valid and Invalid Names: Identify which of the following names are valid or invalid according to the rules:


# first_name
# lastName
# email_address
# percentage
# variable_name
# one_variable
# email_address
# percentage
# internet

# # **Working with** **numbers** **bold text**
# We'll learn about the following topics:
# 1. Types of Numbers in Python
# 2. Basic Arithmetic
# 3. Differences between classic division and floor division


# Python has various "types" of numbers (numeric literals).
# 1. We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers.
# Integers are just whole numbers, positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.
# 2. Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating point number in Python.

# #addition
print(2+1)
# #multiplication
print(2*2)
# #division
print(6/2)
# #modulo
print(7%4) #remainder of 7 divided by 4 
# #powers
print(2**3) #2 to the power of 3
# #get the max and min of a number
print("the max of 2 and 3 is",max(2,3))
#max means the highest number
print("the min of 2 and 3 is",min(2,3))
#min means the lowest number
# #round a number
print("round 3.9 is",round(3.9))
# # absolute value
print("the absolute value of -3 is",abs(-3))
#absolute value means distance from 0
#it is always postiive

# # order of operations
print("2 + 10 * 10 + 3 is",2 + 10 * 10 +3)
#order of operations is the same as in math
#it means do the multiplication first
# then do the addition 

# #to do more you need to import special math libraries from python
from math import *    
# #this goes out and grabs some different math functions we can use
# #floor method 
print("the floor of 3.7 is",floor(3.7))
print("the floor of 5.6 is",floor(5.6))
#floor means round down
# #ceil method
print("the ceil of 3.7 is",ceil(3.7))
print("the ceil of 5.6 is",ceil(5.6))
#ceil means round up
# #sqrt method

# So what have we learned? We learned some of the basics of numbers in Python. We also learned how to do arithmetic and use Python as a basic calculator. We then wrapped it up with learning about Variable Assignment in Python.
# # **Getting Input from users**
# #how do we get input from users?
# input("what is your name?")
name = input("what is your name?")
print("Hello",name)
# # basic math calculator
# #ask the user for 2 numbers
num1= int(input("enter a number:"))
num2 = int(input("enter another number:"))
# # print out a statement where you:
# # add them together
print(num1 + num2)
# #multiply
print(num1 * num2)
# # find the max number
print(max(num1,num2))
# # find the remainder of the numbers
print(num1 % num2)
# #round one number
print(round(num2))



num3 = int(input("enter a number:"))
num4 = int(input("enter another number:"))
print("The number when subtracted is",(num4 - num3))
print("The number when divided is",(num3/num4))
print("The min is",min(num3,num4))
print("The absolute value of your first number is",abs(num3))
print("The floor of your second number is",floor(num4))
print("The ceil of your first number is",ceil(num3))
